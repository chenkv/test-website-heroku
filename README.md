## About The Dashboard

The dashboard portion of the Cloud Analytics team is focused on creating a public dashboard which displays an interactive map and statistics on gun violence around the world. Unfortunately for us, there isn't much specific data on any other country besides the US, so our project is currently focused on US data.

### Built With

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
* [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Installation

Create a directory, initialize git, and pull from this branch. If you would like, you can use [nodeenv](https://pypi.org/project/nodeenv/) to create a virtual environment. Then in the terminal, run:
    
    $ npm install

which should install all of the dependencies.
    
To start the server locally, use:
    
    $ npm run dev
    
which you can then access from your browser at localhost:3000.
